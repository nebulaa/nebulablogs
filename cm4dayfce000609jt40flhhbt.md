## Introduction

Infrastructure as code (IaC), also known as software-defined infrastructure, allows the configuration and deployment of infrastructure components faster with consistency by allowing them to be defined as a code and also enables repeatable deployments across environments.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of IaC Security is to:

* **Ensure Compliance**: Align infrastructure configurations with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
    
* **Detect Misconfigurations**: Identify potential security risks or inefficiencies in the infrastructure setup that could lead to data breaches, performance issues, or unauthorized access.
    
* **Optimize Costs**: Ensure resources are being used efficiently without unnecessary expenses due to mismanagement or over-provisioning.
    
* **Maintain Consistency**: Guarantee uniformity across different environments and teams, reducing errors and inconsistencies.
    

## Implementation Steps

### Static Code Analysis for IaC

Ensuring that the IaC code is developed and maintained in a secure manner, including by following industry-standard practices, using testing frameworks to validate changes, and using version control to track changes to the code.

Use of IDE plugins and automated code analysis tools can help to identify potential security issues in the code as early as possible.

#### Linting

[TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) is a Terraform linter that provides a set of rules for identifying potential issues in Terraform code. It can be used to enforce security best practices and to catch common mistakes and errors.

[Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) is a Dockerfile linter that helps you build best practice Docker images.

#### Identify IaC misconfigurations

[Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) is a static code analysis tool for IaC. It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, Terraform plan, Cloudformation, AWS SAM, Kubernetes, Helm charts, Kustomize, Dockerfile, Serverless, Bicep, OpenAPI or ARM Templates and detects security and compliance misconfigurations using graph-based scanning.

#### Identify hard-coded or leaked secrets

[GGShield](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield) is a CLI application that runs in the local environment or in a CI environment to help detect secrets and scan for infrastructure as code vulnerabilities.

[TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) is a tool for detecting and scanning for secrets in code repositories.

## Deployment

### Inventory Management

**Commissioning** - whenever a resource is deployed, ensure the resource is labeled, tracked and logged as part of the inventory management.

**Decommissioning** - whenever a resource deletion is initiated, ensure the underlying configurations are erased, data is securely deleted and the resource is completely removed from the runtime as well as from the inventory management.

**Tagging** - It is essential to tag cloud assets properly. During IaC operations, untagged assets are most likely to result in ghost resources that make it difficult to detect, visualize, and gain observability within the cloud environment and can affect the posture causing a drift. These ghost resources can add to billing costs, make maintenance difficult, and affect the reliability. The only solution to this is careful tagging and monitoring for untagged resources.

### Immutable Infrastructure

The idea behind immutable infrastructure is to ensure that the infrastructure changes are built around a specific set of requirements and further changes are tracked, tested and validated before they are deployed. This approach helps to prevent unintended changes, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures that the cloud environment is consistent and reliable and prevents configuration drift.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring

Once IaC has been deployed, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure ongoing security, compliance, and efficiency. Tools like [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (Open Policy Agent) **AWS Config**, **Azure Policy**, or **Google Cloud Config Validator** can help monitor infrastructure changes and ensure compliance with organizational policies. Additionally, real-time alerting systems should be in place to notify teams of any anomalies or unauthorized changes.

### Security Audits

Periodic security audits are a vital part of maintaining IaC security. These audits should evaluate the effectiveness of current configurations, identify areas for improvement, and ensure compliance with the latest industry standards and regulations.

## Best Practices for IaC Security Implementation

1. **Shift Left Security**  
    Incorporate security checks early in the development lifecycle. This reduces the cost and complexity of fixing issues later on.
    
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
    Ensure that resources deployed using IaC adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the permissions necessary for their operation.
    
3. **Environment Segmentation**  
    Isolate different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to minimize the risk of accidental or malicious cross-environment access.
    
4. **Encryption**  
    Ensure that sensitive data in transit and at rest is encrypted using industry-standard protocols and practices.
    
5. **Centralized Logging**  
    Implement a centralized logging solution to collect, analyze, and respond to events across your IaC-managed infrastructure.
    
6. **Regular Backups**  
    Automate the process of taking regular backups of critical configurations and data. Test recovery procedures to ensure reliability in the event of a failure
