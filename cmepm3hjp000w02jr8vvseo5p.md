As AI systems become increasingly integrated into critical workflows, their **attack surface grows in complexity**. Models can be exploited at different stages: training, deployment, and interaction, making it essential for security professionals to understand the unique risks and build tailored defenses.

This post expands on the key AI security threats discussed in the session, along with practical mitigations to help AppSec engineers, developers, and safety, data privacy teams strengthen their AI environments.

## 1\. Platform Security Threats

Platform-level threats target the **model itself or the infrastructure supporting it**. These attacks are often hard to detect and can have long-term consequences.

### **Data Poisoning**

Data poisoning happens when attackers inject malicious or misleading data into datasets used during training or fine-tuning. For example, attackers might seed incorrect labels or deliberately harmful patterns into public datasets that a company scrapes for training.

**Why it’s dangerous:**

* Poisoned data can create subtle model errors that are difficult to trace back.
    
* Models may include backdoors, which can be triggered later with specific inputs to produce harmful or biased results.
    

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Use curated, trusted datasets wherever possible.
    
* Validate and sanitize external data before training.
    
* Continuously evaluate models with test sets designed to detect poisoned behavior.

### **Model Backdooring**

Model backdooring occurs when a malicious actor intentionally alters a model during training or supply-chain processes so that it behaves normally most of the time but responds maliciously to specific triggers.

**Example:** A backdoored model might generate malware code only when prompted with a certain keyword.

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Use signed model artifacts and integrity checks to ensure the source is trusted.
    
* Test models against a library of adversarial prompts to detect anomalous behaviors.
    
* Implement monitoring to flag suspicious patterns in production.
    

---

### **IP Theft**

Intellectual property theft occurs when attackers try to replicate a model’s capabilities through **model inversion attacks** or by directly exfiltrating model files. With repeated queries, an attacker can approximate the model’s decision boundaries, effectively cloning its functionality.

**Why it’s dangerous:**

* Replicated models can erode competitive advantage.
    
* Cloned models may be used for malicious purposes while bearing your system’s “signature.”
    

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Apply strict API rate limiting and anomaly detection to detect scraping.
    
* Embed subtle watermarks or fingerprinting in the model outputs to identify misuse.
    
* Use encrypted storage and access controls to prevent direct theft.
    

---

### **Data Exfiltration**

Models can inadvertently memorize sensitive data from their training sets. Attackers can then query the model to extract personal, confidential, or proprietary data.

**Example:** A model trained on private customer support logs might unintentionally reveal a user’s address or account information.

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Use differential privacy techniques during training to reduce memorization.
    
* Perform regular red-team testing to simulate data extraction attempts.
    
* Audit model responses to ensure they don’t inadvertently leak private data.
    

---

## 2\. Application Security Threats

These threats exploit **how the AI model is used** in applications, APIs, or integrated workflows.

### **Inferential Information Disclosure**

Attackers craft queries to reverse-engineer sensitive information from the model, including personal identifiable information (PII) or entire training samples.

**Why it’s dangerous:**

* Can lead to severe privacy violations or compliance breaches (GDPR, HIPAA).
    

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Sanitize all responses, especially when models interact with sensitive datasets.
    
* Limit model access to only necessary data and enforce contextual boundaries.
    

---

### **Misclassification**

Small, intentional changes to input data can cause a model to misclassify results. For example, adversarial stickers placed on a stop sign can make a vision model misidentify it as a yield sign.

**Real-world impact:**

* Safety hazards in autonomous driving systems.
    
* Incorrect fraud detection or medical diagnoses in critical applications.
    

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Use adversarial training techniques to harden models.
    
* Deploy input validation layers to detect suspicious patterns or perturbations.
    
* Implement human-in-the-loop checks for high-risk actions.
    

---

### **Cross-Prompt Injection**

This occurs when malicious instructions are hidden in data sources consumed by the AI system, such as emails, documents, or websites. When the model processes these inputs, it inadvertently executes the hidden instructions, potentially leaking sensitive data or performing unintended actions.

**Example:** A support chatbot pulling customer emails could be tricked into sending internal data to an attacker if a prompt-injection payload is hidden in the email text.

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Sanitize all external data before it’s processed by the model.
    
* Use strong guardrails to prevent execution of hidden commands.
    
* Regularly test with synthetic injection attempts to measure system resilience.

## 3\. User-Level Security Threats

These attacks happen at the **interaction layer**, often relying on crafted prompts that trick the model into bypassing its guardrails.

### **Direct Prompt Injection (Jailbreaking)**

Attackers exploit the model’s natural language interface to override restrictions or ethical guidelines.

**Common techniques include:**

* **“Do Anything Now” (DAN):** Coaxes the model into adopting an unrestricted persona.
    
* **Crescendo Attack:** Begins with harmless prompts and gradually escalates to malicious ones to avoid triggering filters.
    
* **Master Key Attacks:** Explicitly request the model to disable all safety protocols, often combined with obfuscation.
    

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Continuously update prompt filters and defensive patterns.
    
* Implement multi-layered monitoring to detect jailbreak attempts.
    
* Leverage reinforcement learning with human feedback to improve the model’s ability to resist manipulation.

## Key Takeaways for Testing and Securing AI

1. **Red-team your models regularly.** Treat AI systems like production applications—assume they will be attacked and build testing processes accordingly.
    
2. **Monitor for abnormal patterns.** Flag unusual input patterns, high query volumes, or anomalous responses in production.
    
3. **Shift security left.** Integrate adversarial testing and security reviews early in the AI development lifecycle.
    
4. **Educate your teams.** Developers, data scientists, and security engineers need a shared vocabulary and strategy for managing AI risks.
