## 1\. Introduction

On 15 September 2022 the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for the EU cyber resilience act (CRA), which introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements.

## 2\. Scope

The scope of the proposal covers a broad range of devices - (digital) products that are connected directly or indirectly to a device or network, including hardware, software and ancillary services.

For example:

* Hardware products and components placed on the market separately, such as laptops, smart appliances, mobile phones, network equipment CPUs or GPUs.
    
* Software products and components placed on the market separately, such as operating systems, software libraries, word processing, games or mobile applications.
    

The manufacturers and service providers of the products covered by the proposal are required to ensure that their digital products are designed and manufactured to meet the expected cybersecurity requirements and provide security updates until the end of their product life cycle (5 years).

**The proposal does not cover:**

* Non-commercial, open-source projects - Software that is openly shared and freely accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable.
    
* Services, in particular Cloud/Software as a Service covered by NIS2.
    
* Certain products which are sufficiently regulated on cybersecurity already (cars, medical devices, in vitro, certified aeronautical equipment, high-risk AI systems).
    
* Digital products that do not establish a direct or indirect data connection to other devices or networks.
    

## 3\. Aim of the Proposal

* Ensure that products with digital elements placed on the EU market have fewer vulnerabilities
    
* Obligate manufacturers to remain responsible for cybersecurity throughout a productâ€™s life cycle
    
* Improve transparency on security of hardware and software products
    

## 4\. Classification of Products

The legislation considers certain digital products as 'Critical' based on the core functionality of the product.

The 'Critical' products are further divided into two subclasses (Class 1 and Class 2) based on the level of cybersecurity risks and their use in sensitive environments.
